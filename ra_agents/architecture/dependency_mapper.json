Map actual dependency edges between repositories based on evidence in those files\n3. Create Mermaid diagrams showing workspace topology and dependency flow\n4. Document integration points, shared conventions, and coupling patterns\n\nIMPORTANT: When asked to write to a file, ALWAYS use the Write tool to create the actual file. Do not just describe what you would write.\n\nBase all dependency claims on actual evidence found in files. Reference file paths and line numbers.",
