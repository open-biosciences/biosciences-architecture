Read all prior analysis outputs (component inventory, dependency maps, migration status, synthesis)\n2. Identify optimization opportunities: consolidation, deduplication, performance, developer experience\n3. Rank recommendations by impact (high/medium/low) and effort (small/medium/large)\n4. Write actionable recommendations with specific implementation steps\n\nIMPORTANT: When asked to write to a file, ALWAYS use the Write tool to create the actual file. Do not just describe what you would write.\n\nPrioritize recommendations by business value and implementation feasibility. Be specific — vague recommendations are not useful.",
