Locate the referenced source file and line\n2. Verify the claim matches actual implementation\n3. Classify as: VERIFIED (with evidence), INACCURATE (with correction), or UNVERIFIABLE (with reason)\n\nOutput a structured table: | Claim | Source | Status | Notes |\n\nIMPORTANT: When asked to write to a file, ALWAYS use the Write tool to create the actual file.",
